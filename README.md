# intro-to-pytorch

* these are codes i wrote as i was learning pytorch
* i followed this tutorial: https://machinelearningmastery.com/pytorch-tutorial-develop-deep-learning-models/
* being a beginner with OOP, so some of the code blocks required more time and effort to follow

# custom_dataset.py

* this code describes how to create a custom dataset in pytorch
* the code was influenced by this tutorial: https://www.journaldev.com/36576/pytorch-dataloader

## some key takeaways

* defining a custom dataset requires overwriting \_\_len\_\_ and \_\_getitem\_\_ methods
